# v1.1.0

- Add MobileMenuLayer and MobileMenuItem components, replacing MenuLayer and MenuItem from @alethio/cms package

# v1.0.1

- Added CursorInfinitePagination. When total items count is unknown, the pagination checks if there is a next page to show the next page button or not.

# v1.0.0

- Stable release

# v1.0.0-beta.24

- Updated wrapper and reexport for styled-components

# v1.0.0-beta.23

## Breaking Changes

- HorizontalBar is not responsive anymore. Since the responsiveness was only used by TopBar this one has now his own HorizontalBar that is responsive

## Other changes

- Added icons for DexWatch, Discord, Hamburger, social media
- Added optional prop to Fade: active (defaults to true) to control the initial state

# v1.0.0-beta.22

- (ToolbarIconButton): Add toggle functionality

# v1.0.0-beta.21

- (AccordionHorizontal, AccordionVertical) Fix arrow position when container offset is 0.

# v1.0.0-beta.20

# v1.0.0-beta.19

- (EthValue, EthValueBox): Make ETH symbol configurable
- Fix some typings for components with defaultProps. This could be a breaking change, if the components were consumed incorrectly before, by omitting some required props (this was possible, depending on the TS version used, and is now fixed).

# v1.0.0-beta.18

- Updated the Alethio palette colors

# v1.0.0-beta.17

- (Grid): Flexible row height

# v1.0.0-beta.15

## Breaking Changes

- AlethioReportsIcon was changed to another version in which the svg doesn't use mask, so the size and color are optional parameters now like in the other standard icons

# v1.0.0-beta.5

## Breaking Changes

- (AccordionHorizontal, AccordionVertical): accordion items are no longer passed via `items` prop. New `AccordionItem` child component will be used instead.

- (ITheme): Label color property has been renamed (`label` => `label.default`). `arrowLabel*` properties have been removed
