# Alethio Explorer UI

Library of UI components usable inside Alethio Explorer plugins

## Requirements

- The components will only work inside an Alethio Explorer plugin. They depend on its plugin API which is dynamically created at runtime.

- A bundler is required as the library exports individual files in ES module format.
